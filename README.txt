Five Things - Kevin Jackson - 06/2016


This app was created to demonstrate my knowledge gained from a course at Udacity.
The app should teach the user five things, I choose the topic of audio as by trade I am an Audio Engineer.

Five things should walk the user through 5 topics using 7 different activities. The user advanced by
pressing a next button or in certain circumstances checking a box and then pressing a next button.
The text will scroll if the user wants to read in landscape the layout should be usable in either orientation. 
Five Things uses custom jpg images made by the creator using Google Drawing and Gimp. 


The original design changed from a card based UI as I have a limited understanding of list
and recycler views. I decided to change the desing to something I as famalier with so that 
I could master these layouts before tackling a greater challenge. 

I tested this app on my Nexus 6p running Android Marshmellow 6.0.1 

The app should work well on any Android device that is running Android 4.0 and up.
